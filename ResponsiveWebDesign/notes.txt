-Primary colors in the RGB color wheel are the colors that, added together, create pure white light. These colors are red, green and blue.

 In the RYB color wheel, primary colors are colors that canâ€™t be mixed from other colors. There are three primary colors: red, yellow, and blue.

-Secondary colors are colors that result from mixing two primary colors. There are three secondary colors. In the RGB color wheel, these are cyan, magenta 
 and yellow. When you mix light, red and green make yellow, green and blue make cyan, and blue and red make magenta.

 In the RYB color wheel, the secondary colors are purple (red mixed with blue), orange (red mixed with yellow), and green (yellow mixed with blue).

-Tertiary colors are colors made by combining a secondary color with a primary color. There are six tertiary colors. In the RGB color wheel these are orange,
 chartreuse green, spring green, azure, violet and rose.

 In the RYB color wheel, the tertiary colors are red-orange, yellow-orange, yellow-green, blue-green, blue-violet, and red-violet.

-A color wheel is a circle where similar colors, or hues, are near each other, and different ones are further apart. For example, pure red is between the hues
 rose and orange.
 Two colors that are opposite from each other on the color wheel are called complementary colors. If two complementary colors are combined, they produce gray.
 But when they are placed side-by-side, these colors produce strong visual contrast and appear brighter.

-Notice that the red and cyan colors are very bright right next to each other. This contrast can be distracting if it's overused on a website, and can make text hard to read
 if it's placed on a complementary-colored background.
 It's better practice to choose one color as the dominant color, and use its complementary color as an accent to bring attention to certain content on the page.
